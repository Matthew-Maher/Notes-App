#Notes-App
**Team Project â€“ Summer 2025**
**Authors:** Matthew Maher, Jack Williams, and Mahatab Hussain

### Overview
A mobile notes and sketching application built with React Native, Expo, and Skia. This application allows for navigation through multiple note pages and a toolbox for user controls.
Our app integrates with Google Gemini to analyze user notes/ drawings. Gemini offers meaningful insight into the current page's sketched content. 

This project was developed as a collaborative learning experience to strengthen skills in full-stack development, React/TypeScript, UI/UX design, and AI integration.
